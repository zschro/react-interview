# Interview Instructions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Use any online resources necessary to complete these steps, but please do any searching in the same window being shared. You can add additional npm packages. Refactor and remove the existing code as needed. There is at least one bug in the existing code that will need to be fixed when moving to step two.

## Step One

Update the Number Lister component so that when you type a number into the box it will list out that many numbers in the table below.

Example: 
![list-example](/list-example.jpg)

## Step Two

Update the MyProfile component to retrieve data from https://randomuser.me/api and display it.

Example:
![profile-example](/profile-example.jpg)
